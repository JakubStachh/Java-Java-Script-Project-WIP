# 🔍 Longest Word Finder Function

## 📚 Overview
This JavaScript function takes a sentence as input and returns the **longest word** in that sentence. It splits the sentence into words, then iterates over them to determine which one has the greatest length.

## ⚙️ Function

### `longestWord(sentence)`

#### 🧾 Parameters:
- `sentence` (String): A sentence containing multiple words.

#### 🎯 Returns:
- The **longest word** in the sentence. If there are multiple words with the same length, it returns the first one.

---

## 🧪 Example Usage

```javascript
function longestWord(sentence) {
    return sentence.split(" ").reduce((longest, word) => word.length > longest.length ? word : longest, "");
}

console.log(longestWord("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")); // "jumps" ✅
console.log(longestWord("I love programming in JavaScript")); // "programming" ✅
console.log(longestWord("Go for a run")); // "for" ✅
```

---
## 🔍 How It Works
- The function first splits the input sentence into an array of words using `split(" ")`.

- It then uses the `reduce()` method to iterate over the array and compare the lengths of the words.

- The longest word is returned. If two words have the same length, the first one is chosen.

---
## 📊 Example Output
- Given `longestWord("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")`, the output is `"jumps"` because it is the longest word in the sentence.

- For `longestWord("I love programming in JavaScript")`, the result is `"programming"`.

- In the case of `longestWord("Go for a run")`, the output is `"for"` because it is the longest word (first).
