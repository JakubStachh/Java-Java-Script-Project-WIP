## 📦 La Installation `Java` & `JavaScript` 

### 𓀃 The Actual Installation🤌🤌

#### You can use [Programiz Complier](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/online-compiler/) or similar online compliers to run the code

#### But if you're using e.g. Windows Powershell you should:

- Make sure you have Java installed. You can install it using [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/?er=221886):

  ```
  java -version
  ```
  
- [Download](https://github.com/JakubStachh/Java-Java-Script-Project/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the code
- Unpack the zip file
- Open the folder of the program You want to try out 
- and then run:
  
  ```
  javac HelloWorld.java
  java Main
  ```
  Or just: 
  ```
  java HelloWorld.java
  ```
##
- For `JavaScript` make sure You got [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en) installed:
 
  ```
  node -v
  ```
  
  & `NPM`
  ```
  npm -v
  ```
  
- Then You'll need to run the `JavaScript` file using `Node.js`:
  
  ```
  node app.js
  ```
